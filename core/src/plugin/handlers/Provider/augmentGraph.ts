    Add actions and/or dependency relationships to the project stack graph. See the individual output fields for
    details.

    The handler receives all configured providers and their configs, as well as all previously defined actions
    in the project, including all actions added by any \`augmentGraph\` handlers defined by other providers
    that this provider depends on. Which is to say, all the \`augmentGraph\` handlers are called and their outputs
    applied in dependency order.

    Note that this handler is called frequently when resolving action configuration, so it should return quickly
    and avoid any external I/O.

        Add dependencies between different actions, where \`by\` depends on \`on\`.

        The most common use case for this field is to make an existing action depend on one of the actions specified under \`addActions\`.
